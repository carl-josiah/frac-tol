In the $(NAME): rule, you tell make how to build your final program.

Concrete Objective:
Inside the $(NAME): rule, put the command to compile all object files into the final executable.

What to write: $(CC) $(CFLAGS) $(OBJS) -Lmlx -lmlx -framework OpenGL -framework AppKit -o $(NAME)

Explanation:
$(CC) — your compiler (like cc or gcc)
$(CFLAGS) — your flags (like -Wall -Wextra -Werror)
$(OBJS) — your compiled .o files
-Lmlx -lmlx — link to the MiniLibX library (assuming it's in ./mlx)
-framework OpenGL -framework AppKit — required frameworks on macOS
-o $(NAME) — name of your final executable

-Lmlx tells the linker where to look for libraries.
It means: “Look in the mlx directory for libraries.”
-lmlx tells the linker which library to link.
It means: “Link against the library named mlx (libmlx.a or libmlx.dylib).”
